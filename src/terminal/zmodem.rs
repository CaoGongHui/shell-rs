//! ZMODEM in a terminal: `rz` and `sz` on the other end of the connection,
//! as Xshell and SecureCRT take them. The parser thread hands every chunk
//! of output to [`Zmodem`] before the emulator sees it. With no transfer
//! running it only looks for the header `rz` and `sz` open with, and
//! passes the rest on; during one, the bytes are the protocol's, and what
//! it answers goes back to the other end. The protocol itself is the
//! `zmodem2` crate: this is the wiring, the files, and the lines the
//! terminal shows of it.
